# short term
. set up scripts for creating a new git project
. set up pipe project
. implement create_view using pipe, with error handling

# use cases
• read directory names into database
• read file names into database
• add main view
• add relationships between folders into database
• add relationship between files and folders into database

# project_to_do
• create full use case for every possilbe command
• create functionality to read file system into database (2 abstract views)
• create functionality to detect changes to abstract file system
• create functionality to update in line with file system
• create different types of abstract data file
• work through each of the use cases

# go from database + viewfile + concrete view to new view
This algorithm needs to be very simple, to make reasoning about the other
algorithms easier
